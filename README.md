ToDo Project created with Webpack, Babel, and pubSub pattern.
------------------------------------------------------------

    Aside for myself: I've had to learn a lot until I felt comfortable starting this project. I took some time learning how to install webpack, babel, and editing configuration files. I practiced setting up src and dist folders and learned how to use the pubSub pattern. I'd like to learn more about webpack and git. I'd also like to learn more programming patterns. I'll practice using classes and functional inheritance again at some point too. I'm also trying to remember the SOLID pinciples currently.
